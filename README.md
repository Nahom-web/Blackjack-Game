# Blackjack-Game

Course: Web Programming II

Assignment 4

I have created a blackjack game that includes a basketball theme. Firstly, it brings you to an animation page. Secondly, a form will appear prompting you to enter all the fields required to become a player. After everything is filled out and submitted the form, you have officially became a player and can play blackjack against the dealer.
